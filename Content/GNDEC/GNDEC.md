Students of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) have bagged second position in the state and 11th nationwide at the Effi-cycle Competition organised by the Society of Automotive Engineers Northern India Section (SAE NIS), India, at Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab
A team of 12 students from the mechanical engineering branch of the college participated in this one-of-its-kind contest for which they built an electrically-powered manual cycle. More than 80 teams from across the country participated in various dynamic and static events.
Sahil Bisht, captain of the team, and Simranpreet Singh, vice-captain, said making this project had been a great learning experience for the team. The project could only be completed because of the contribution of all team members, they added. Apart from Sahil and Simranpreet, Gagan Sadyal, Ankit Kumar, Ketav Sharma, Kartik, Nitish, Bhavuk Dhingra, Akshay Soni, Nishant, Pranesh and Saijal were part of the team.
The project has a star feature of motor capacity power of 600 Watts, which is enough capacity to attract investors in the market. Running at 500 rpm with a torque of 10 Nm, its acceleration reaches from 0 to 100 m in only 13 seconds. Having a load capacity of approximately 300 kg, the motor is capable of delivering 35 kmph top speed (electrical) and 40 kmph top speed (hybrid).
“We are aware that the market is flooded with entrepreneurs looking for an opportunity to invest in hybrid vehicles. The top speed of 40 kmph (hybrid) at a loading capacity of 300 kg will definitely attract investors,” said Bilga, head, Department of Mechanical Engineering, GNDEC.
Being a mechanical engineer himself, principal Sehijpal Singh showed optimism and confidence in his team and applauded the efforts of the students and the faculty. He added that the experience gained by students in such events would equip students with professional and social skills, which would be helpful in building successful careers.
