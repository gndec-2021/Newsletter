## Department at a Glimpse

 This department was established in the year 1957, whose role is to deliver excellent quality education in the field of Applied Sciences for the future technocrats of all engineering streams. The department also endeavours to inculcate the scientific temper and the spirit of inquest in students. It inspires the students to realize and therefore apply the physical laws to the growth and development of their fields of study. We intensely think that an educational programme should be able to stimulate the development of a balanced and harmonious personality of the students. Hence, the educational program of GNDEC has been customised -to suit such necessities.

### AIM

The Department of Applied Sciences targets to provide a robust foundation in the basic science subjects of Engineering Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Professional English. We emerge as an International level Institute in producing and propagating knowledge, and providing students an exceptional learning experience in the discipline of science and technology that will best serve the world and advancement of mankind.

### MISSION

The task of the Applied Sciences Department is to succeed, sustain and foster unsurpassed excellence in technical education. We chase continuous progress of infrastructure and boost state-of-the art capacities to offer our students a technologically up-to-date and knowledgeably stimulating environment of learning and guarantee high quality content by qualified faculty members who establishes the marks of excellence in their every endeavour.
