I am delighted to see the latest version of college newsletter ready for circulation and that too with altogether a new makeover. I congratulate the entire editorial team for its continuous and sustained efforts in capturing an admirable kaleidoscopic view of collaborative journey of strivings and accomplishments of faculty and students.
To my mind, education is not just a process of giving knowledge for a future job but a lifelong process which enriches minds and provides varied experiences that last a lifetime. GNDEC is dynamic place of learning where all endeavours are focused at transforming lives of our budding technocrats for evolving better worlds of their fulfilled dreams. The extensive list of our globally settled alumni speaks volumes about it. This newsletter is one such platform enabling us to showcase unswerving efforts put by our competent faculty and students while staying steadfast on their ongoing march of attaining excellence in their respective fields.
I congratulate the entire editorial team for designing the newsletter in such an excellent way. Good Luck!
